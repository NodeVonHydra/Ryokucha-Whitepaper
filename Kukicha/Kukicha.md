# Kukicha (茎茶)

**Kukicha (茎茶)**, also called bōcha, is a very funny little tea. It is a mixture of tea stems and all sorts of twigs, which mostly come from sencha or matcha production. This gives kukicha a unique grassy, hay-like flavor and aroma that sets it apart from other types of tea. 

Since the vast majority of the tea's caffeine is found in its leaves, **kukicha is therefore a very light tea** and suitable for evening drinking.
