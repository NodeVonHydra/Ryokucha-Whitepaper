# Tamaryokucha

**Tamaryokucha** is a type of Japanese green tea that is known for its unique shape and flavor. The name "Tamaryokucha" translates to **"coiled green tea"** in Japanese, and it is characterized by its curled, twisted leaves.

Tamaryokucha has a curley look and is often produced using the Chinese method. The Chinese technique involves iron pans for roasting the tea in order to prevent oxidation (kill green). This version of Tamaryokucha is also called **Kamairicha**. Kama the iron pan used for roasting.
