# Kamairicha

**Kamaricha** is a type of Japanese green tea that is made from tea leaves that have been tightly rolled into small, pellet-like shapes. The name "Kamaricha" translates to **"curled tea"** in Japanese, and it is known for its unique appearance and flavor.

To make Kamaricha, the tea leaves are harvested and processed in a traditional way, using a rolling process that compresses the leaves into small, round shapes. The tea is then dried and roasted, giving it a distinctive nutty flavor and aroma.

The rolling process used to make Kamaricha also gives the tea a unique texture, with a slightly chewy and satisfying mouthfeel. The flavor of Kamaricha is described as being slightly sweet and nutty, with a smooth and mellow taste.

There are actually two types of Kamairicha: **Tamaryokucha**, which is processed to curly leaves and Kamanobicha which is rolled into needles like Sencha.
