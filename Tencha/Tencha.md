**Tencha** is a shaded Japanese green tea that is mostly **used to make matcha** but it's sometime also used for cooking. Tencha is grown like gyokuro. That means the tea leaves are shaded for about three weeks. That is the reason why matcha got such a vivid green color. After harvest the leaves are briefly steamed and dried but in contrast to most other Japanese teas not rolled. Finally the leaves are separated from their stems and veins. 

In terms of flavor, Tencha has a delicate, slightly sweet taste and a smooth, velvety texture. It is often enjoyed as a high-end tea on its own, as well as used as an ingredient in cooking and baking to add a unique flavor and color to dishes.
