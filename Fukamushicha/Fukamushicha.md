# Fukamushicha (深蒸し茶)

**Fukamushicha (深蒸し茶)** literally means **“deep-steamed tea”** and as the name suggests, it is a tea that is steamed a little longer than most tea varieties. It is usually produced in Shizuoka Prefecture.

The classic ryokucha is steamed for about 30 to 40 seconds and the resulting product is called futsuumushicha (普通蒸し茶, “normal steamed tea”). Fukamushicha, by comparison, is **steamed for one minute and sometimes longer**.

The steaming process greatly affects the taste of the green tea. The main advantage of using the fukamushi process is that it suppresses the bitterness while extracting a little more fullness and sweetness from the flavour.

The longer steaming time causes the tea leaves to be very soft and the tips often break off during the process of rolling into the needles. These tiny particles make fukamushicha look as if it is a lower quality tea, but in reality it is definitely not.

The appearance of fukamushicha may therefore be a disadvantage, but the small tea particles only mean that the health benefits are increased (of course, with the right preparation and the right quality of tea). As with matcha and funmatsuchi, by drinking small solid particles we can get more nutrients (such as catechins) from the tea, plus nutrients that are not water-soluble, such as fiber, some vitamins and chlorophyll.

Fukamushicha is also slightly more difficult to prepare compared to other teas. If the strainer in your teapot has holes that are too wide, the particles will not filter through. The infuser should also have a large surface area, as fukamushicha can quickly clog up a surface that is too small. That’s where the miraculous kyusu teapot, designed specifically for ryokucha, comes in, which among other things is a great choice (also) for making fukamutsicha.
