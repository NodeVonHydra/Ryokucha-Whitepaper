# Tamaryokucha (玉緑茶)

**Tamaryokucha**, also known as "curly green tea" or "coiled tea," is a type of Japanese green tea that is pan-fired or steamed and then rolled into curled or twisted shapes. It has a unique appearance and is often characterized by its irregular, wiry leaves. The flavor profile of Tamaryokucha can vary, but it generally produces a smooth and slightly sweet taste with a mild vegetal or grassy aroma.

Tamaryokucha is only produced in Kyushu around Ureshino in Saga prefecture. In all other areas is mostly Sencha produced. 

Tamaryokucha is similar to Goricha, another Japanese pan fried tea. While both Tamaryokucha and Guricha have similarities in terms of their appearance and the way they are processed, they can have slight variations in flavor and aroma due to differences in cultivation regions and production methods. However, it's important to note that the terminology and naming conventions for Japanese green teas can vary, and sometimes Tamaryokucha and Guricha may be used interchangeably depending on the region or context.
