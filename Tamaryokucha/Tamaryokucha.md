# Tamaryokucha (玉緑茶)

**Tamaryokucha**, also known as "curly green tea" or "coiled tea," is a type of Japanese green tea that is pan-fired or steamed and then rolled into curled or twisted shapes. It has a unique appearance and is often characterized by its irregular, wiry leaves. The flavor profile of Tamaryokucha can vary, but it generally produces a smooth and slightly sweet taste with a mild vegetal or grassy aroma.

Tamaryokucha is only produced in Kyushu around Ureshino in Saga prefecture. In all other areas is mostly Sencha produced. 

Tamaryokucha is similar to Goricha, another Japanese pan fried tea.
