# Mecha (芽茶)

**Mecha** is made from the the buds of Gyokuro or shaded Sencha (Kabusecha) plants. Although Mecha is made from the same plant as Gyokuro or Sencha, it's less popular. The taste of Mecha is comparable to Gyokuro and Sencha but the shape looks much different. Mecha is rolled into beeds while other Japanese tea is usually rolled into needle shape
