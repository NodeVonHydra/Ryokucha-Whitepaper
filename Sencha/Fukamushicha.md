# Fukamushicha 

**Fukamushicha**, also known as **deep-steamed green tea**, is a type of Japanese green tea that undergoes a longer steaming process than other types of green tea (special steaming method from Shizuoka is used). During the production process, the tea leaves are steamed for a longer period of time (typically around 1-2 minutes) compared to other green teas, such as sencha or gyokuro, which are usually steamed for around 30 seconds to 1 minute.

The **longer steaming process of fukamushicha results in a tea with a more intense and bold flavor profile, as well as a darker green color**. The deep steaming breaks down the cell walls of the tea leaves, releasing more flavor compounds and catechins. This results in a tea that is often described as having a richer and more full-bodied taste with a thicker mouthfeel.
