# Sencha (煎茶) 

**Sencha** is the most common type of tea in Japan and can be found in a huge variety of different forms. If you’ve heard of a type of ryokucha, it’s very likely that it’s either sencha or that it originated from sencha.

**70% of all sencha from Japan comes from the Yabukita cultivar** (tough, frost resistant leaves). However, if a grower wants to produce a lighter or sweeter tea, he will most likely reach for a more unique cultivar, such as Saemidori or Okumidori. These cultivars require a little more care and their yield may be slightly less than Yabukita.

Before the tea leaves are harvested, however, the farmer must decide whether or not to cover the tea leaves.

One of the unique characteristics of sencha is its distinctive **grassy and vegetal flavor profile**, which is a result of the steaming process used in its production. This process helps to preserve the natural flavors and aromas of the tea leaves, resulting in a tea that is rich in umami (savory taste) and contains high levels of antioxidants, particularly catechins and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG).
