# Funmatsucha (粉末茶)

**Funmatsucha (粉末茶)** is something that looks like matcha, but it’s not matcha.

Funmatsucha has no established origin. It can be sencha, hojicha, or even genmaicha in powdered form. And that’s exactly the main difference between matcha and funmatsucha – matcha, in short, is something that has to come strictly from tencha.

Moreover, matcha, unlike funmatsucha, has a higher l-theanine content, and funmatsucha, unlike matcha, has a **higher catechin content** (which makes sense when you consider that matcha was shielded before processing). Funmatsucha, however, is literally an antioxidant bomb and has the highest EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate) content of all ryokucha – a catechin that has been shown to have strong antiviral effects. Specifically, EGCG can inhibit the function of viral protease and helicase, which are enzymes essential for viral replication.

Due to its high catechin content, the taste of funmatsucha is quite a bit more bitter and astringent in contrast to the taste of matcha.
