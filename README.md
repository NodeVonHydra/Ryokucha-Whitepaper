**The Ryokucha Whitepaper** is a comprehensive work that explores the importance and benefits of Japanese green tea, also known as ryokucha. With a rich history dating back to the 8th century, ryokucha has become a staple in Japanese culture and is renowned for its unique flavor and numerous health benefits. This whitepaper delves into the science behind ryokucha, examining its nutritional content and the ways in which it can promote overall health and wellness. Additionally, it explores the cultural significance of ryokucha, from the traditional tea ceremony to its modern-day popularity around the world. 

**Ryokucha and l-theanine allows evolution to superhuman. Let the future be in our hands!**

In this README.md file, you will learn about the basic ryokucha cultivars as well as the different methods of its preparation based on the steaming period ad shading methods. If you are interested in individual tea strains, view code.

# Cultivars

Ryokucha, which refers to Japanese green tea, is made from different cultivars of the tea plant *Camellia sinensis*. Each cultivar has unique characteristics that influence the flavor, aroma, and color of the resulting tea. Here are some of the most popular Ryokucha cultivars:

## Yabukita

- first developed in the 1900s by a tea farmer named Yamamoto Kahei in Shizuoka, Japan
- covers 75% of the area of Japanese tea fields (data from year 2010) and 90% in Shizuoka prefecture, where it was developed
- thick leaves that survive the winter
- relatively low catechin content, which is a type of antioxidant found in tea (this results in a mild and slightly sweet taste)

## Yutakamidori

- breed of Asatsuyu cultivar
- second most used cultivar after Yabukita
- early harvest time
    - picked more than 5 days earlier than Yabukita
- mainly grown in Kagoshima and Miyazaki and is resistent against fungal disease

## Okuyutaka

- bred from selected seeds of the Yutakamidori cultivar
- picked two days later than Yabukita, and has a higher yield
- makes a good quality sencha :)
- fares well in cold weather
- its young leaves harden quickly, so there’s a short time window before the quality starts to decrease

## Okumidori

- developed in the 1970s by the National Institute of Tea, part of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries in Japan
- hybrid of Yabukita and native cultivar “Shizuoka Zairai #16″
- rich umami taste, sweetness, and a mild astringency
- typically used for the production of high-quality sencha, gyokuro, and matcha teas

## Saemidori

- means 'clear green'
- mainly grown in the Kagoshima region of Japan, where its unique taste and color have made it a highly prized tea plant variety
- developed in the late 1990s by the National Institute of Vegetable and Tea Science in Japan through a crossbreeding program between two different tea plant varieties: the Asatsuyu (extremely susceptible to frost) and Yabukita cultivars
- it was meant for sencha production but now it is also used for fukamushicha and gyokuro
- delicate, sweet, and refreshing taste with a hint of astringency + large amount of umami

## Asatsuyu

- also know as 'natural Gyokuro'; the taste of the cultivar is similar to Gyokuro without the need to go through the shading process
  - its name means “morning dew”, and when made into sencha it brews into a bright, yellow color
- leaves are tender, so care must be taken when steaming and rolling

## Shizu-7132

- often used in the production of fukamushi-cha, a type of deep-steamed green tea
- rich, full-bodied taste and a deep green color

## Gokou

- rare cultivar with stronh umami taste and low bitterness
- originated from a seed of a native plant in Uji
  - many such seedlings where raised and Gokou was selected as the best of them in 1953
- meant for gyokuro and tencha (which ultimately results in matcha)

## Asanoka

- developed in Kagoshima by crossing Yabukita and a Chinese cultivar named Hiramizu #1 (平水１号)
- slightly early budding, with a strong cold resistance

# Shading

By covering the tea plants with shading material, tea producers can slow down the growth of the leaves and encourage the development of certain chemical compounds that give the tea a unique flavor and aroma.

Shading prevents the breakdown of l-theanine into catechins (antioxidants). Catechins have a bitter taste, while l-theanine is characterized by an umami taste. Shading the tea also induces a stress response in the plant, which produces more chlorophyll and caffeine. Here are some of the most common shading methods used in the production of Ryokucha:

## Jikakabuse

**Jikakabuse** (Direct Shading - 直冠せ): the simplest and cheapest shading method. Black synthetic cloth is draped directly over the plants, blocking out around 70% of the sunlight. A second layer can be added to increase the shading to around 95%. Putting the shading material directly on the tea requires that the plants be machine-trimmed to have an even surface. This machine-trimming gives many Japanese tea bushes their distinctive rounded shape. The even surface it creates is perfect for harvesting the tea leaves by machine as well, although they can also be hand-picked. This style of shading is most commonly used for shaded sencha and kabusecha, it is also used occasionally for gyokuro and tencha.

## Kanreisha

**Kanreisha** (Shelf-style with Synthetic Cloth - 寒冷紗): the most common shading method. Here, the black fabric is held in a canopy, or shelf, built over the tea bushes. This allows greater air and moisture circulation and also lets the plants grow more freely. Some shelf-shaded teas are grown untrimmed as shizen-shitate (自然仕立て- naturally-tailored) bushes, meaning that the bushes grown naturally and unshaped, which produces higher quality tea, but also makes them unsuitable for machine-harvesting, requiring these teas to be picked by hand. In this diagram the tea bush has a machine rounded shape.

## Honzu

**Honzu** (Shelf-style with Reeds and Straw Mats - 本簀): the most traditional shading method. Dating back at least over 400 years, the Honzu method uses the same shelf system as kanreisha but uses a screen of reeds as the first layer of shading instead of synthetic fabric. Though considerably more labour intensive and expensive to construct, the reed screen allows for even more air and moisture to circulate around the plants producing higher-quality, more complex teas. Additional layers of shading are added by placing straw mats on top of the reed screen. Most honzu-shaded fields are grown as shizen-shitate as shown above.

    • Shading time classification includes:
        ◦ Sencha: Non-shaded tea
        ◦ Kabusecha: Lightly shaded for around 1-2 weeks before harvesting.
        ◦ Gyokuro: Highly shaded for around 3-4 weeks before harvesting.

# Steaming time

    • Asamushi: Lightly steamed for 30 seconds or less, producing a refreshing and delicate taste.
    • Chumushi: Moderately steamed for 30-60 seconds, resulting in a balanced flavor and aroma.
    • Fukamushi: Deeply steamed for 60-120 seconds, more sweeter flavor (An invention of World War II, when the Japanese were not importing tea to the U.S., so they deliberately made it sweeter by deep-steaming it to find new customers)

The deep-steaming technique used in fukamushi results in a more intense, bold, and rich flavor profile, as well as a darker green color. This is because the longer steaming time (around 1-2 minutes) breaks down the cell walls of the tea leaves, releasing more flavor compounds and catechins (a type of antioxidant found in tea). The resulting tea is also typically more powdery and has a thicker, fuller mouthfeel.

On the other hand, the light-steaming technique used in asamushi results in a lighter and more delicate flavor profile, with a brighter green color. The shorter steaming time (around 30 seconds to 1 minute) preserves more of the tea leaves' natural flavors and aromas, resulting in a tea that is more nuanced and subtle in taste.

# Research and health benefits

Ryokucha contains a variety of enzymes, amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, sterols, polyphenols, carotenoids, tocopherols, vitamins, caffeine and related compounds, phytochemicals and dietary minerals. Numerous claims have been made for the health benefits of green tea based on chemical composition, in vitro and animal studies, though results in humans have been inconsistent and few clear benefits for humans have been demonstrated. There is also evidence suggesting consuming large volumes of green tea, and in particularly green tea extracts, may cause oxidative stress and liver toxicity.

A 2012 systematic review concluded the evidence that green tea can prevent cancer "is inadequate and inconclusive" but with some evidence for a reduction in certain types of cancer (breast, prostate, ovarian and endometrial). Green tea may lower blood low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol levels, though the studies were of short duration and it is not known if these effects result in fewer deaths and evidence does not support green tea reducing coronary artery disease risk. Several randomized controlled trials suggest green tea can reduce body fat by a small amount for a short time, though it is not certain if the reduction would be meaningful for most people.
