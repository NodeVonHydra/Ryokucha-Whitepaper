**The Ryokucha Whitepaper** is a comprehensive work that explores the importance and benefits of Japanese green tea, also known as ryokucha. With a rich history dating back to the 8th century, ryokucha has become a staple in Japanese culture and is renowned for its unique flavor and numerous health benefits. This whitepaper delves into the science behind ryokucha, examining its nutritional content and the ways in which it can promote overall health and wellness. Additionally, it explores the cultural significance of ryokucha, from the traditional tea ceremony to its modern-day popularity around the world. 

**Ryokucha and l-theanine allows evolution to superhuman. Let the future be in our hands!**

In this README.md file, you will learn about the basic ryokuche cultivars as well as the different methods of its preparation based on the steaming period.

# Cultivars

Ryokucha, which refers to Japanese green tea, is made from different cultivars of the tea plant *Camellia sinensis*. Each cultivar has unique characteristics that influence the flavor, aroma, and color of the resulting tea. Here are some of the most popular Ryokucha cultivars:

## Yabukita

- first developed in the 1900s by a tea farmer named Yamamoto Kahei in Shizuoka, Japan
- covers 75% of the area of Japanese tea fields (data from year 2010) and 90% in Shizuoka prefecture, where it was developed
- thick leaves that survive the winter
- relatively low catechin content, which is a type of antioxidant found in tea (this results in a mild and slightly sweet taste)

## Okumidori

- developed in the 1970s by the National Institute of Tea, part of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries in Japan
- hybrid of Yabukita and native cultivar “Shizuoka Zairai #16″
- rich umami taste, sweetness, and a mild astringency
- typically used for the production of high-quality sencha, gyokuro, and matcha teas

## Saemidori

- means 'clear green'
- mainly grown in the Kagoshima region of Japan, where its unique taste and color have made it a highly prized tea plant variety
- developed in the late 1990s by the National Institute of Vegetable and Tea Science in Japan through a crossbreeding program between two different tea plant varieties: the Asatsuyu (extremely susceptible to frost) and Yabukita cultivars
- it was meant for sencha production but now it is also used for fukamushicha and gyokuro
- delicate, sweet, and refreshing taste with a hint of astringency + large amount of umami

## Asatsuyu

- also know as 'natural Gyokuro'; the taste of the cultivar is similar to Gyokuro without the need to go through the shading process
  - its name means “morning dew”, and when made into sencha it brews into a bright, yellow color
- leaves are tender, so care must be taken when steaming and rolling

## Shizu-7132

- often used in the production of fukamushi-cha, a type of deep-steamed green tea
- rich, full-bodied taste and a deep green color

## Gokou

- rare cultivar with stronh umami taste and low bitterness
- originated from a seed of a native plant in Uji
  - many such seedlings where raised and Gokou was selected as the best of them in 1953
- meant for gyokuro and tencha (which ultimately results in matcha)


# Shading

By covering the tea plants with shading material, tea producers can slow down the growth of the leaves and encourage the development of certain chemical compounds that give the tea a unique flavor and aroma.

Shading prevents the breakdown of l-theanine into catechins (antioxidants). Catechins have a bitter taste, while l-theanine is characterized by an umami taste. Shading the tea also induces a stress response in the plant, which produces more chlorophyll and caffeine. Here are some of the most common shading methods used in the production of Ryokucha:

**1. Tana** - involves placing shading material over the tea plants, which are grown on a platform or shelf. This method is typically used for the production of high-end teas like gyokuro, which require a longer shading period (up to three weeks) to develop their delicate flavor and aroma.

**2. Jikagise** - involves using a movable shading material that is adjusted to gradually increase or decrease the amount of sunlight that the tea plants receive. This method is often used in the production of Kabusecha, which requires a shorter shading period (around one to two weeks) to develop its unique flavor and aroma.

**3. Yama** - involves placing shading material directly on the tea plants, which are grown on a sloping hillside. This method is often used in the production of high-quality Sencha, which requires a shorter shading period (around one week) to develop its unique taste and aroma.

**4. Honzu** - involves covering the tea plants with a flat, rectangular shading material. This method is typically used in the production of fukamushi-cha, a type of deep-steamed green tea that requires a shorter shading period (around one week) to develop its bold and rich flavor.

    • Shading time classification includes:
        ◦ Sencha: Non-shaded tea
        ◦ Kabusecha: Lightly shaded for around 1-2 weeks before harvesting.
        ◦ Gyokuro: Highly shaded for around 3-4 weeks before harvesting.     

# Steaming time

    • Asamushi: Lightly steamed for 30 seconds or less, producing a refreshing and delicate taste.
    • Chumushi: Moderately steamed for 30-60 seconds, resulting in a balanced flavor and aroma.
    • Fukamushi: Deeply steamed for 60-120 seconds, more sweeter flavor (An invention of World War II, when the Japanese were not importing tea to the U.S., so they deliberately made it sweeter by deep-steaming it to find new customers)

The deep-steaming technique used in fukamushi results in a more intense, bold, and rich flavor profile, as well as a darker green color. This is because the longer steaming time (around 1-2 minutes) breaks down the cell walls of the tea leaves, releasing more flavor compounds and catechins (a type of antioxidant found in tea). The resulting tea is also typically more powdery and has a thicker, fuller mouthfeel.

On the other hand, the light-steaming technique used in asamushi results in a lighter and more delicate flavor profile, with a brighter green color. The shorter steaming time (around 30 seconds to 1 minute) preserves more of the tea leaves' natural flavors and aromas, resulting in a tea that is more nuanced and subtle in taste.
