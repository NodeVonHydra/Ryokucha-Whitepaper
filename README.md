**The Ryokucha Whitepaper** is a comprehensive work that explores the importance and benefits of Japanese green tea, also known as ryokucha. With a rich history dating back to the 8th century, ryokucha has become a staple in Japanese culture and is renowned for its unique flavor and numerous health benefits. This whitepaper delves into the science behindryokucha, examining its nutritional content and the ways in which it can promote overall health and wellness. Additionally, it explores the cultural significance of ryokucha, from the traditional tea ceremony to its modern-day popularity around the world. 

**Ryokucha and l-theanine allows evolution to superhuman. Let the future be in our hands!**

# Cultivars

## Yabukita

- first developed in the 1900s by a tea farmer named Yamamoto Kahei in Shizuoka, Japan
- covers 75% of the area of Japanese tea fields (data from year 2010) and 90% in Shizuoka prefecture, where it was developed
- thick leaves that survive the winter
- relatively low catechin content, which is a type of antioxidant found in tea (this results in a mild and slightly sweet taste)

## Okumidori

- developed in the 1970s by the National Institute of Tea, part of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries in Japan
- hybrid of Yabukita and native cultivar “Shizuoka Zairai #16″
- rich umami taste, sweetness, and a mild astringency
- typically used for the production of high-quality sencha, gyokuro, and matcha teas

## Saemidori

- means 'clear green'
- mainly grown in the Kagoshima region of Japan, where its unique taste and color have made it a highly prized tea plant variety
- developed in the late 1990s by the National Institute of Vegetable and Tea Science in Japan through a crossbreeding program between two different tea plant varieties: the Asatsuyu (extremely susceptible to frost) and Yabukita cultivars
- it was meant for sencha production but now it;s also used for fukamushicha and gyokuro
- delicate, sweet, and refreshing taste with a hint of astringency + large amount of umami

# Shading

Shading prevents the breakdown of l-theanine into catechins (antioxidants). Catechins have a bitter taste, while l-theanine is characterized by an umami taste. Shading the tea also induces a stress response in the plant, which produces more chlorophyll and caffeine.

    • Shading time classification includes:
        ◦ Sencha: Non-shaded tea
        ◦ Kabusecha: Lightly shaded for around 1-2 weeks before harvesting.
        ◦ Gyokuro: Highly shaded for around 3-4 weeks before harvesting.     

# Steaming time

    • Asamushi: Lightly steamed for 30 seconds or less, producing a refreshing and delicate taste.
    • Chumushi: Moderately steamed for 30-60 seconds, resulting in a balanced flavor and aroma.
    • Fukamushi: Deeply steamed for 60-120 seconds, more sweeter flavor (An invention of World War II, when the Japanese were not importing tea to the U.S., so they deliberately made it sweeter by deep-steaming it to find new customers)

The deep-steaming technique used in fukamushi results in a more intense, bold, and rich flavor profile, as well as a darker green color. This is because the longer steaming time (around 1-2 minutes) breaks down the cell walls of the tea leaves, releasing more flavor compounds and catechins (a type of antioxidant found in tea). The resulting tea is also typically more powdery and has a thicker, fuller mouthfeel.

On the other hand, the light-steaming technique used in asamushi results in a lighter and more delicate flavor profile, with a brighter green color. The shorter steaming time (around 30 seconds to 1 minute) preserves more of the tea leaves' natural flavors and aromas, resulting in a tea that is more nuanced and subtle in taste.
