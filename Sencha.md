Sencha is the most common type of tea in Japan and can be found in a huge variety of different forms. If you’ve heard of a type of ryokucha, it’s very likely that it’s either sencha or that it originated from sencha.

70% of all sencha from Japan comes from the Yabukita cultivar (tough, frost resistant leaves).

However, if a grower wants to produce a lighter or sweeter tea, he will most likely reach for a more unique cultivar, such as Saemidori or Okumidori. These cultivars require a little more care and their yield may be slightly less than Yabukita.

Before the tea leaves are harvested, however, the farmer must decide whether or not to cover the tea leaves.
