# Matcha (抹茶)

**Matcha (抹茶)** is a type of Japanese green tea that is made from shade-grown tea leaves that are ground into a fine powder. The term "matcha" translates to **"powdered tea"** in Japanese, and it is known for its distinctive bright green color and unique taste.

What most people don’t know, however, is that this stone-grinder method of processing tea is not some kind of specialty of Japanese connoisseurs. In fact, it was the traditional way of preparing almost every tea in ancient China, but it has only survived in Japanese tea culture today.

Most matcha comes from the Yabukita cultivar, but even in this country it’s not hard to come across the matcha cultivars Okumidori, Saemidori, or Asahi. Of course, the territory in which matcha grows is also very important. The best green-tea-producing prefectures in Japan, such as Kyoto, Aichi and Shizuoka, produce matcha.

The tea leaves for matcha production are usually harvested from early to mid-May. Twenty days before they are harvested, however, the tea bushes are covered with either straw or the slightly less traditional plastic polymer. During these twenty days, layers of blanket are gradually added to the tea bushes to reduce the amount of light falling on them. This process will make the tea plant panic. It will start to produce more chlorophyll and likewise high levels of l-theanine, which would easily be broken down in the light into other substances such as tannins and catechins, will remain in the tea plant.

These l-theanine- and chlorophyll-loaded leaves are then **steamed for 15 to 20 seconds to prevent oxidation**, and finally dried. **At this point, the tea leaves are called Aracha**, which is actually just a cool name for some midpoint of matcha production. Next, the producers take the Aracha and remove all of the stems and veins, leaving only the clean fleshy and leafy parts. These pieces are then dried and at this point they are called **Tencha**. The tea master comes on the scene and tastes the tencha from different plantations and mixes several variations of it for the greatest flavor complexity. Once the tea master manages to blend the right flavours, the tencha is then ground into matcha.

Grinding matcha in a stone grinder is quite a complex process. The resulting powder particles should be no more than **10 micrometers in size**, and the entire grinding process must be done cold so as not to accidentally denature any nutrients in the tea. Among other things, it’s also a pretty slow process – it takes about one hour to grind 30 grams of matcha.

So, once we have the matcha ready, we should know something about its qualities. There are generally three types of matcha – **standard, ceremonial and so-called ‘brewing’ matcha**.

The production of matcha requires a lot of detailed processes, and if the producer does not pay enough attention to any of them, he will produce matcha of lower quality. For example, if the matcha was not really shaded, or if the veins and stems of the aracha were not removed in sufficient detail, or if the tea leaves were picked from the second harvest and not the first, or if the leaves were not ground long enough and in a real stone grinder, etc.

Such lower quality matcha, i.e. matcha suitable for cooking, is therefore a thingy that is only suitable for use in the kitchen.

Standard matcha is actually just fine matcha made from tencha, and finally there is ceremonial matcha, which must be shaded for at least 15 days, must be carefully de-veined, must be ground in a low-temperature grinder, and its particles must be extremely small.

## Usucha, Koicha and traditional matcha brewing

**Usucha and Koicha** are two traditional ways of preparing matcha, a type of Japanese green tea made from finely ground tea leaves. Here is a detailed explanation of each:

### Usucha

**Usucha**, also known as "thin tea," is a lighter and more frothy version of matcha. For preparing usucha, you need:

- 2 chashaku per 50 to 60 ml of water/25 to 30 ml of water per one chashaku of matcha

To prepare usucha, the matcha powder is sifted into a bowl, and hot water (around 70-80°C or 158-176°F) is added to the bowl.

Usucha is supposed **to be whisked**, and a regular electric milk churn will do the trick. Some tea masters may be able to do it quite nicely with a bamboo whipper, but for the average person, the desired froth without mechanics is a great utopia. After all, Usucha is not about following some thousand-year-old tradition, but about getting the desired consistency and quality of tea. And truly, nothing is as efficient these days as an electric beater.

Usucha tastes very pleasantly creamy, but it’s certainly not as highly viscous and strong as Koicha.

### Koicha

**Koicha**, also known as "thick tea," is a more concentrated version of matcha that has a richer and more intense flavor. It is typically made using higher quality matcha and a smaller amount of water. For preparing koicha, you need:

- 4 chashaku (or about two teaspoons) per 40 ml of water/10 ml of water to one chashaku of matcha

The Koicha is only to be mixed gently in a circular motion and not whisked (this time you need a traditional bamboo whisk). The desired effect would be impossible to achieve with a conventional coffee shop electric milk whipper. Koicha is not supposed to have any bubbles and no foam. It is supposed to be, in short, a thick and unprocessed shot.
