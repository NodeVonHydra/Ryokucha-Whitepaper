# Houjikonacha

Although it is not very common, konacha can be roasted into so-called **houjikonacha**. The heat treatment reduces the bitterness and gives the tea a roasted flavour and aroma. Houjikonacha is also an ingredient in the Japanese dish **chagayu**, which is actually just a very fancy name for rice and tea.
