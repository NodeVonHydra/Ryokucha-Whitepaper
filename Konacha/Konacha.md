# Konacha (粉茶)

**Konacha (粉茶)** is a type of Japanese green tea that is **made from the fine particles and dust** that are left over from the processing of other types of Japanese green tea, such as sencha or Gyokuro. The name "Konacha" translates to "powder tea" in Japanese, and it is known for its strong flavor and unique texture.

To make Konacha, the leftover tea particles and dust are collected and blended together. The resulting tea has a strong, robust flavor and a dark green color. The texture of Konacha is unique among Japanese green teas, as it has a thick, creamy texture that is often described as being similar to the texture of matcha.

Konacha is mostly found as a very economical tea offered in many sushi restaurants, and needless to say, in most cases it’s a pretty big mess. However, you can certainly find some konacha of better quality than those in sushi restaurants, but it will still be more or less just the best of the worst.
