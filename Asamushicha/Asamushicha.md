# Asamushicha (浅蒸し茶)

**Asamushicha (浅蒸し茶)** or "light-steamed tea", is a type of green tea that is steamed for a lower time than normal, resulting in a lighter flavor and aroma. Asamushicha presents as a light and refreshing drink, and it is slightly tannic, tending to be a bit more astringent. The taste is similar to other green teas, but with a lighter flavor.

Asamushicha has a steaming time of 30 seconds or less, while fukamushicha (deep-steamed tea) is steamed for a minute or more. This type of tea has leaves that are almost intact, in contrast to fukamushicha where the tea leaves are so fragile that they’re usually broken.

Most often than not, the light steamed green teas are sencha.
