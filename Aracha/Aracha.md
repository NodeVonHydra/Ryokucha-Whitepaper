# Aracha

**Aracha** is a type of Japanese green tea that is known for its unique and rustic appearance. The name "Aracha" translates to **"rough tea"** in Japanese, and it is characterized by its unrefined, unsorted leaves.

To make Aracha, the tea leaves are harvested and processed in a traditional way, without the extensive refining and sorting that is used for other types of Japanese green tea. As a result, Aracha **tea leaves often contain stems, twigs**, and other plant matter, giving the tea a rustic appearance.

The processing method for Aracha also gives the tea a unique flavor and aroma. The flavor is often described as being full-bodied and earthy, with a slightly astringent taste. The aroma of Aracha is often compared to that of freshly cut grass or hay.
