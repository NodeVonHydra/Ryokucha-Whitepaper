# Hakuta Bancha (伯太番茶)

**Hakuta Bancha (伯太番茶)** is a type of sun-dried bancha named after Hakuta town, in Shimane prefecture.

This tea is low in caffeine and has a faint bitterness. Although not as popular as kyobancha (another regional type of bancha), it is produced all year round and you can easily order it online in Japan.

Hakuta Hancha leaves are harvested and immediately steamed. Then they are dried under the sun. Once dry, the leaves are roasted at low heat for a period of time. Note that there is no rolling process involved, unlike other types of Japanese green tea. The finished leaves look rather big, and have a dark brown color. It looks as if they had withered naturally.

Both the taste and color of the liquid are similar to houjicha.
