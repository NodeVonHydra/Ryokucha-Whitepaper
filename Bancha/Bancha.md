# Bancha (番茶)

**Bancha (番茶)** is the second flush of Sencha and is harvested between summer and autumn. The term "bancha" translates to **"everyday tea"** in Japanese, and it is often described as having a simple and rustic taste compared to other types of green tea. Bancha leaves are more mature and have a lower content of catechins and other compounds compared to younger tea leaves used for other types of green tea like sencha or gyokuro.

Bancha is often described as having a simple, slightly bitter taste with a nutty or earthy aroma. It is also lower in caffeine than other types of green tea, which makes it a popular choice for those who are sensitive to caffeine.
