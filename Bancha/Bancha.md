# Bancha

**Bancha** is the second flush of Sencha and is harvested between summer and autumn. The term "bancha" translates to "everyday tea" in Japanese, and it is often described as having a simple and rustic taste compared to other types of green tea. Bancha leaves are more mature and have a lower content of catechins and other compounds compared to younger tea leaves used for other types of green tea like sencha or gyokuro.
