# Boke bancha (歩危番茶)

**Boke bancha (歩危番茶)** is a type of sun dried (nikkan) bancha, but unlike Yoshino nikkan bancha it isn’t roasted at the end.

The name comes from Ōboke valley in Tokushima prefecture. The place that it’s made in more quantity is Miyoshi city (三好市).

This tea has little bitterness and astringency, and offers a mellow flavor.
