# Mimasaka Bancha (美作番茶) 

**Mimasaka Bancha (美作番茶)** is a type of sun-dried bancha produced in the Okayama prefecture, especially the city of Mimasaka.

Mimasaka bancha is also called sakushuu bancha (作州番茶)  and musashi bancha (武蔵番茶). Sakushuu was another name for the Mimasaka province, which was located at the northeast of the Okayama prefecture.

On a very hot summer day, the bancha leaves are picked and placed in an iron pot and steamed/simmered. Then, the leaves are placed in the ground so that they are slowly dried under the sun. Every now and then, the leaves are sprinkled with broth obtained from the initial simmering. There’s also a roasting process at the end, but this process is not done always.
