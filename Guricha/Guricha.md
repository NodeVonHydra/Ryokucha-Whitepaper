# Guricha (ぐり茶)

**Guricha**, also referred to as **"Tamaryokucha"** or "curly tea" is type of Japanese green tea. Unlike the more common Japanese green teas that are steamed, Guricha undergoes a pan-firing process similar to Chinese green teas. This pan-firing gives the tea a distinct shape and flavor. Guricha has twisted or curled leaves, similar to Tamaryokucha, but it can also include some open, broad leaves. The taste of Guricha is often described as being rich, mellow, and slightly nutty.

While both Tamaryokucha and Guricha have similarities in terms of their appearance and the way they are processed, they can have slight variations in flavor and aroma due to differences in cultivation regions and production methods. However, it's important to note that the terminology and naming conventions for Japanese green teas can vary, and sometimes Tamaryokucha and Guricha may be used interchangeably depending on the region or context.
